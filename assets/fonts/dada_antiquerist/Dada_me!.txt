Thank you for downloading this font!
This DaDa inspired font was made some years ago, and I have made som minor changes to it now. 
All letters are caps, but they are different, so that you will get a more random hand written feeling with a little use of the caps lock. 
With two similar letters next to eachother, just do like this: AabB and so on.

Freeware! Use this for whatever graphical purpose you like!
